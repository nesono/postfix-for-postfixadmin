# Docker Image with Postfix for Postfixadmin

This repository defines a docker image that can be used to build up a mail server with the postfixadmin docker image.

## Credits

Most ideas and scripts have been taking from [bokysan/docker-postfix](https://github.com/bokysan/docker-postfix).
The actual configuration was taken from my [old work](https://www.nesono.com/node/276) on a Postfix mail server.
